    "\"\"\"ans 1)An exception in Python is an error that occurs during the execution of a program, \n",
    "which disrupts the normal flow of the program and may cause it to terminate prematurely.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are many built-in exceptions that are raised when an error occurs, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ZeroDivisionError: Raised when attempting to divide by zero\n",
    "- TypeError: Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type\n",
    "- ValueError: Raised when an operation or function receives an argument of inappropriate value\n",

    "On the other hand, syntax errors are errors that occur when the Python interpreter is unable to understand or interpret the code due to a syntax mistake, \n",
    "such as a missing parenthesis or a misplaced operator. Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter before the program is executed,\n",
    "and they must be fixed before the program can run.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that exceptions occur during the execution of a program,\n",
    "while syntax errors occur before the program is executed. \n",
    "In addition, exceptions can be handled by the program to prevent premature termination and allow for error recovery,\n",

    "\"\"\"ans2)When an exception is not handled, it can lead to unexpected or undesirable consequences in a program. \n",
    "Let's consider an example to understand this better:\n",
    "Suppose we have a simple program that takes two numbers as input from the user and performs division. \n",
    "The program assumes that the user will always enter valid numeric values, but it does not include any error handling mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n",
    "num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n",
    "result = num1 / num2\n",
    "print(\"The result of the division is:\", result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's consider a scenario where the user enters zero as the second number. \n",
    "In this case, a ZeroDivisionError will occur because dividing a number by zero is not mathematically possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the program does not handle this exception, the following things can happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Program Termination: When an unhandled exception occurs, the program will terminate abruptly. \n",
    "In our example, the program will stop running, and no further instructions will be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Error Message: The interpreter/compiler will display an error message that includes the type of the exception (ZeroDivisionError) and \n",
    "a traceback that indicates the line of code where the exception occurred. This error message might not be meaningful to the user and can be confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Incomplete Operations: In our example, if the exception is not handled, \n",
    "the program will not print the result of the division. This can leave the program in an inconsistent state where some operations are incomplete or skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data Loss or Corruption: If the program was performing critical operations or manipulating important data, \n",
    "an unhandled exception can result in data loss or data corruption. In our example, if the program was storing the result in a file or a database,\n",
    "that operation might not be executed, leading to incomplete or inaccurate data records.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent these undesirable consequences, it is important to handle exceptions appropriately in programs. \n",
    "Exception handling allows developers to anticipate and gracefully respond to potential errors,\n",
    "ensuring that the program can recover or handle the situation in a controlled manner."

    "\"\"\"3ans)In Python, the statements used to handle exceptions are `try`, `except`, `else`, `finally`, and `raise`.\n",
    "These statements allow developers to catch and manage exceptions in a controlled manner. Here's an explanation of each statement with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `try` and `except`: The `try` statement is used to enclose the code that may raise an exception. \n",
    "If an exception occurs within the `try` block, it is caught and handled by the corresponding `except` block.\n",
    "Multiple `except` blocks can be used to handle different types of exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n",
    "    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n",
    "    result = num1 / num2\n",
    "    print(\"The result of the division is:\", result)\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, if a `ZeroDivisionError` or `ValueError` occurs within the `try` block, the respective `except` block will handle the exception and display an appropriate error message.\n",
    "This prevents the program from terminating abruptly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `else`: The `else` block is optional and follows all the `except` blocks. It is executed only if no exceptions occur within the `try` block.\n",
    "It is useful for performing additional operations when the code within the `try` block runs successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n",
    "    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n",
    "    result = num1 / num2\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"The result of the division is:\", result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, if no exceptions occur while getting user input or performing the division, the `else` block will execute and print the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `finally`: The `finally` block is optional and follows all the `except` and `else` blocks. It is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\n",
    "It is commonly used for releasing resources or performing cleanup operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    file = open(\"data.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "    # Perform some operations on the file\n",
    "except IOError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: File cannot be opened.\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `finally` block ensures that the file is closed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `raise`: The `raise` statement is used to raise an exception manually. It allows developers to create and raise custom exceptions based on certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n",
    "if age < 0:\n",
    "    raise ValueError(\"Error: Age cannot be negative.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, if the user enters a negative value for age, a `ValueError` exception is raised manually using the `raise` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using these exception handling statements, developers can catch, manage, and recover from exceptions, making their code more robust and reliable."
